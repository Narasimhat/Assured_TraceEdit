// From numbers to a decision. The lab does not want 38 percentages, it wants to know which clones to keep, which to hold and which to sequence again.
// Every decision carries its reasons, so that it can be checked against the traces; thresholds are options shown in the report.
//
//   accept         the genotype is what the experiment wanted and the result is reliable enough to act on
//   hold           a usable but not the wanted genotype (heterozygous, mixed, or an intended edit with a partial conversion): keep for a second round or decide by hand
//   reject         the clone does not carry the edit (wild type) or carries the wrong one
//   re-sequence    the data cannot decide (low confidence, an unusable read, reads that disagree, a window too short)
